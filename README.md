# Denmark 1847
An 18XX-style game taking place during 1800s Denmark, starting at the "first" official railway opening in 1847 and ending in the privatisation of the railway in 1880.

Mid-way through the game however the Second Schleswig war breaks out! The southern part of the map falls under Prussian control, and operating in that region becomes less profitable.

How will you handle this?

# About this Project
The project is currently being maintained in an 18xx-maker json file, and is currently still under heavy construction.
Nothing you see right now is final and everything is subject to change.

# Planned Gimmicks
- 18Norway style boats
- Railway mergers
- Tolls
- Maybe privatisation (a-la 18Norway)
