# Denmark 1847

An 18XX-style game taking place during 1800s Denmark, starting at the "first" official railway opening in 1847 and ending in the privatisation of the railway in 1880.

Mid-way through the game however the Second Schleswig war breaks out! The southern part of the map falls under Prussian control, and operating in that region becomes less profitable.

How will you handle this?

# Assembly Instructions

You may have noticed that this game comes with a LOT of charters and a LOT of stocks.
Don't fret, this is on purpose.

When printing out this game, the major and minor company charters of the same colours are glued back-to-back, so that a minor company can be flipped during the game.

Similarly, glue together the president's shares and all the minor shares with three of the major shares in each colour company. The remaining four major shares get the default card back.
